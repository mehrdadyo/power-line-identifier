Feature-enhanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective in power line-vegetation problem space. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and Hough transforms are used to increase the salience of the linear structures like power lines and poles. We used over 1300 images from Google Street View for training the model. Transfer learning on popular CNNs, and feature engineering to place images in one of three classes: (1) no utility systems, (2) utility systems with no overgrown vegetation, or (3) utility systems with overgrown vegetation, was utilized. Test set accuracy with reached 80:15% using VGG11 with a trained first layer and classifier, and a model ensemble correctly classified 88:88% of images with risky vegetation overgrowth.
